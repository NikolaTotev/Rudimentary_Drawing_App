# Rudimentary_Drawing_App
This is again one of my first projects that I created while I was starting out with programming. 
It has some of the basic functions you might expect:
- Choosing color.
- Erasing a brush stroke.
- Changing size of brush.
- Filling in the whole canvas.

Features that I tried to implement but my skill level didn't allow:
- Layers similar to photoshop
- Saving the file.
